# GoRogue_SadConsole
An experiment (for the moment), using GoRogue's new Map/GameObject system and integrating it with SadConsole v8 features.

Currently, this is an experiment with no long-term support intent.  There does exist an actual [in-progress integration library](https://github.com/SadConsole/SadConsole/tree/master/src/SadConsole.GoRogue) for these two packages, maintained by Thraka, creator of SadConsole.
